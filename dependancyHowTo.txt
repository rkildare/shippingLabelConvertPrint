I would recomend isolating these dependancies to a venv; mainly because there seems to be a few tkdnd wrappers out there and I'm not sure if installing multiple would cause any issues. So just to be on the safe side, isolate this one.

Required:

pip install pywin32
pip install pillow #Also known as PIL
pip install pymupdf #This is fitz
pip install python-tkdnd

---------------------
Optional:

pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=myIcon.ico --collect-all tkinterDnD labelConvertPrint.py
